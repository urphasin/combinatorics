# 🧠 Learning Plan: Combinatorics & Number Theory for Competitions and Interviews

Great! Here's a detailed learning plan split into four phases tailored for a beginner aiming to prepare for competitions or interviews involving combinatorics and number theory (e.g., AMC, Olympiads, LeetCode/Codeforces, ICPC, Google Kick Start):

---

## 🟩 Phase 1 – Core Combinatorics (2–3 weeks)
**Goal:** Build strong intuition for counting and basic problem-solving patterns.

### 📘 Topics:
- Fundamental Principle of Counting (Rule of Product, Rule of Sum)
- Permutations & Combinations  
  - \( nPr \), \( nCr \)
- Ordered vs unordered
- Factorials & Properties
- Basic Casework & Overcounting
- Pascal’s Triangle
- Pigeonhole Principle (basic)

### 🧠 Practice:
- Counting items in different orders (cards, books, digits)
- Problems where order matters vs not
- Identify when overcounting happens

### 🛠 Resources:
- *Art of Problem Solving Volume 1* (Combinatorics Chapters)
- [Brilliant.org – Combinatorics](https://brilliant.org)
- Codeforces Div 3/4 Problems (Combinatorics tag)

---

## 🟨 Phase 2 – Intermediate Combinatorics + Light Number Theory (3–4 weeks)
**Goal:** Master deeper combinatorics and start dabbling in basic number theory tools.

### 📘 Topics (Combinatorics):
- Binomial Theorem
- Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
- Pigeonhole Principle (advanced)
- Derangements
- Recurrence Relations (basic)
- Stars and Bars (distributions)

### 📘 Topics (Number Theory intro):
- Divisibility rules
- Prime numbers
- GCD, LCM
- Euclidean Algorithm

### 🧠 Practice:
- Apply inclusion-exclusion to restricted cases
- Solve problems with integer partitions
- Write recursive solutions (e.g., tiling, counting paths)
- Practice computing GCD/LCM efficiently

### 🛠 Resources:
- *1001 Problems in Combinatorics* (Titu Andreescu)
- *Elementary Number Theory* (Dudley or Burton)
- [CP-Algorithms – GCD](https://cp-algorithms.com/)

## 🟦 Phase 3 – Core Number Theory (3–4 weeks)
**Goal:** Master tools necessary for modular arithmetic and number-theoretic problem solving.

### 📘 Topics:
- Modular arithmetic  
  - Addition, multiplication, exponentiation
- Modular inverses
- Fermat’s Little Theorem
- Euler’s Theorem & Totient Function
- Chinese Remainder Theorem
- Prime factorization, Sieve of Eratosthenes

### 🧠 Practice:
- Solve modular inverse problems
- Use Fermat’s/Euler’s theorem to compute fast powers
- Implement sieve to find primes ≤ 10⁶
- Solve congruence equations

### 🛠 Resources:
- *Number Theory* (Titu Andreescu)
- *Competitive Programmer’s Handbook* (Antti Laaksonen)
- [CP-Algorithms – Number Theory](https://cp-algorithms.com/)
- LeetCode tag: Number Theory

---

## 🟪 Phase 4 – Integration + Advanced Topics (4+ weeks ongoing)
**Goal:** Mix both topics in competitive-style problems.

### 📘 Topics:
- Combinatorics with modular arithmetic  
  (e.g., \( \binom{n}{r} \mod p \))
- Burnside’s Lemma (if aiming for Olympiad)
- Dirichlet's Theorem (basics)
- Möbius function & inversion (advanced)
- Dynamic Programming + Combinatorics
- Constructive number theory problems

### 🧠 Practice:
- Solve Codeforces and AtCoder problems with math/combinatorics tags
- Leetcode/Codeforces contests weekly
- Use math to optimize brute-force problems

### 🛠 Resources:
- **YouTube**: Math for Competitive Programming – Errichto, Neal Wu
- [USACO Training Gateway](http://usaco.org/)
- AoPS Intermediate Number Theory
